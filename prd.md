# Product Requirements Document: WebGPU Image Processing Library

**Version:** 1.5
**Date:** May 15, 2025
**Author:** AI Assistant (Gemini) & User
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

The WebGPU Image Processor project aims to develop a high-performance, client-side JavaScript/TypeScript **library** for common image manipulation tasks, leveraging the power of modern GPUs directly within the browser via the WebGPU API. The library will be designed for reusability, utmost performance, and easy integration into various web projects, following data-oriented design principles where applicable. An accompanying **demo application** will serve as a showcase for the library's capabilities and a testbed during development. This document outlines the requirements for the library's Minimum Viable Product (MVP), its future enhancements, and the supporting demo page. A key architectural goal is to implement a graceful fallback mechanism (WebGPU -> WebGL -> WASM -> Pure TypeScript) to ensure broad compatibility.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

### 2.1. Primary Goals
* **Develop a Reusable Library:** Create a robust, well-documented JavaScript/TypeScript library for client-side image processing.
* **Achieve Utmost Performance:** Design and implement the library with a strong focus on performance, leveraging data-oriented design principles.
* **Leverage WebGPU:** Prioritize WebGPU for optimal performance, showcasing its capabilities.
* **Enhance WebGPU Development with Type Safety:** Utilize the TypeGPU library and standard WebGPU type definitions (e.g., from `@webgpu/types`) to ensure type safety and improve developer experience when interacting with the WebGPU API.
* **Implement Fallback Strategy:** Ensure wide usability by providing fallbacks to WebGL, WebAssembly (WASM), and pure TypeScript if WebGPU is unavailable.
* **Provide Core Image Operations:** Offer a set of common and useful image filters and transformations.
* **User-Friendly API:** Design an intuitive and easy-to-use API for developers integrating the library.
* **Publish to NPM:** Make the library accessible to the wider developer community by publishing it on npm.
* **High-Quality Demo Page:** Develop a feature-rich demo page to showcase library features and facilitate testing.
* **Ensure Non-Blocking Processing:** Where feasible, design the library to avoid blocking the main browser thread, potentially through optional WebWorker integration.
* **Explore Node.js Execution (Future):** Investigate and potentially implement support for running the library in a Node.js environment, leveraging the `webgpu` (Dawn Node.js plugin) npm package.

### 2.2. Objectives for Library MVP
* Implement the core library structure in TypeScript.
* Develop a WebGPU-based processing module for at least one common image filter (e.g., Grayscale), integrating TypeGPU for resource and pipeline definitions.
* Utilize standard WebGPU TypeScript types (e.g., `@webgpu/types`) for core API interactions.
* Define a basic public API for loading an image source and applying the implemented filter.
* Set up the initial scaffolding for the fallback mechanism (detect WebGPU, with stubs for other backends).
* Establish a build process for generating distributable library files.

### 2.3. Objectives for Demo Page (Supporting MVP)
* Integrate and utilize the MVP library to perform the Grayscale filter.
* Allow users to upload an image from their local device.
* Display both the original and processed (via the library) images.
* Provide clear status feedback (WebGPU initialization, image loading, processing, errors).
* Ensure a responsive design for common desktop browser screen sizes.

## 3. Target Audience

### 3.1. Library Users
* **Web Developers:** Seeking to integrate efficient client-side image processing into their applications.

* **Responsiveness:** Basic responsiveness for desktop viewing.

## 7. Technical Requirements

### 7.1. Library
* **Language:** TypeScript (ESNext target).
* **Core API:** Asynchronous, Promise-based.
* **Design Philosophy:** Adherence to data-oriented design principles to maximize cache-coherency and throughput, especially for performance-critical paths.
* **Rendering/Processing Backends:**
    1.  **WebGPU (WGSL for shaders) - Primary (Browser & Node.js):**
        * Utilize **TypeGPU** library for type-safe definition of WebGPU resources (buffers, textures, samplers), bind group layouts, pipeline descriptors, and shader interop.
        * Utilize **`@webgpu/types`** for standard WebGPU TypeScript definitions in browser environments.
        * For Node.js execution (post-MVP), the **`webgpu` (Dawn Node.js plugin)** npm package will be the target for providing the WebGPU API.
    2.  WebGL (GLSL for shaders) - Fallback (Browser)
    3.  WebAssembly (e.g., Rust, C++, AssemblyScript) - Fallback (Browser & Node.js)
    4.  Pure TypeScript - Final Fallback (Browser & Node.js)
* **Modularity:** Designed for tree-shaking to minimize bundle size for consumers.
* **Build Tool:** Vite, Rollup, or esbuild for library bundling.
* **No external runtime dependencies for core filtering logic** (beyond TypeGPU for the WebGPU backend, the `webgpu` (Dawn) package for Node.js WebGPU, and any chosen WASM library).
* **WebWorkers (for optional offloading):** To be used for non-blocking operations if implemented.

### 7.2. Demo Page
* **HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript (ES6+).**
* Will consume the **WebGPU Image Processing Library** as a dependency.
* **Build Tool:** Vite recommended for the demo page development server and build.

### 7.3. Supported Browsers (for WebGPU backend)
* Latest stable versions of Google Chrome (Desktop).
* Latest stable versions of Microsoft Edge (Desktop).
* Other browsers with good WebGPU support as they mature (e.g., Firefox, Safari).
* The fallback mechanisms aim to broaden support significantly. Node.js support will depend on the `webgpu` (Dawn) package capabilities.

    * WebWorker communication overhead should be considered if implemented.
* **Demo Page:**
    * Ensure smooth UI interactions even when the library is processing.

## 8. Release Criteria (for Library MVP)

* All "Library Core (MVP)" features (Section 5.1) are implemented and functional.
* The Grayscale filter operates correctly using the WebGPU backend, with TypeGPU integrated for resource and pipeline definitions and usage of `@webgpu/types`.
* The basic public API is usable and allows for image loading and filter application.
* The build process generates distributable library files (e.g., ESM, UMD).
* The demo page successfully utilizes the MVP library to perform and display the grayscale operation on supported browsers.
* No critical bugs or crashes in the library's core WebGPU path or the demo's primary user flow.
* Basic README.md with installation and usage instructions for the library.

## 9. Success Metrics (Post-Launch)

* **Library Adoption:** Downloads and usage statistics from npm.
* **Community Engagement:** GitHub stars, forks, issues, and pull requests (if open-sourced).
* **Performance Benchmarks:** Comparison of processing times across different backends and against other libraries, using standard datasets.
* **Correctness:** High pass rates on tests using standard image datasets.
* **Developer Feedback:** Positive reviews and constructive criticism from library users, including feedback on TypeGPU integration.
* **Demo Page Utility:** Usefulness as a tool for showcasing WebGPU and the library's capabilities.

## 10. Open Issues / Questions

* Specific WASM strategy: Which language (Rust, C++, AssemblyScript) and libraries (if any) for WASM modules?
* Detailed API design for filter parameters and extensibility (e.g., custom filters).
* Error handling strategy across different backends – how to normalize error messages?
* Memory management, especially for GPU resources.
* Approach for testing each backend (WebGPU, WebGL, WASM, TS) effectively.
* What are the next 1-2 highest priority filters/operations for the library after grayscale?
* Strategy for integrating WebWorkers: which parts of the library are best suited for offloading (e.g., image decoding, CPU-bound fallback processing), and how will the API expose this optional feature? How to manage worker lifecycle and communication overhead?
* Which specific data-oriented design patterns are most applicable and beneficial for the various processing backends and data transfer paths?
* What are the licensing implications of any standard image datasets used for testing?
* Extent of TypeGPU integration: Will the library rely solely on TypeGPU's built-in schemas, or will custom schema generation (e.g., using `tgpu-gen`) be necessary for more complex operations or shader interoperability?
* What is the best strategy for integrating and managing the `webgpu` (Dawn Node.js plugin) npm package for Node.js support, including handling its specific initialization (e.g., `navigator = { gpu: create([]) }`) and lifetime management within the library's architecture?
* How will the library abstract image input/output for Node.js (e.g., reading from file buffers, outputting to file buffers) given the `webgpu` (Dawn Node.js plugin) package does not provide HTML element integration?
